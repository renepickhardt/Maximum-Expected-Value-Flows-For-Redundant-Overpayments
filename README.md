## This is work in progress

Thus it is not openly licensed yet as the work is not finnished yet and I cannot suggest to use this in production or copy it.

I only share it here for others to give feed back and potentially collaborate.

in particular for the code to run you need a patched (and very experimental) version of the pickhardt payments lib which you can find at: https://github.com/renepickhardt/pickhardtpayments/pull/36
